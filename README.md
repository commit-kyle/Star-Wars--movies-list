## General info
This project is simply lists Star Wars movies when requested by the user.

The content is retrieved from the Star Wars API -- [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/api/films/) -- through the use of the 'Fetch' Web API. 

The method is called when a button, clearly visible upon startup, is clicked by the user. This then fetches the list of movies made available by SWAPI.

In addition, a loading animation makes for a visually pleasing wait, whilst data is fetched. However, this retrieval is relatively fast.
